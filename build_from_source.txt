# Build NYT, RCV1 and Yelp datasets from source

We use train/test/val splits as given by the source dataset.

The required target data format is .csv with the following columns:
text,label_1,label_2,...,label_n

"text" contains the input text, "label_i" is either 0 or 1.

In order to create the label columns, we first crawl all labels from the dataset
and organize them in a hierarchy. Hierarchies are stored in a .csv with the following columns:
parent_class,child_class

for examples of file format.

We use only leaf classes - that means we omit all labels that occur on the left side as parents 
and remove them from the dataset. If a sentence will have 0 labels as a result of this process
we remove it from the dataset entirely.
